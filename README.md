## About johnnydaux.org

The "daux" in "johnnydaux" is meant to be pronounced "doe". On the [actual site](https://johnnydaux.org) I explain how my name, Johnny, isn't all that unique and, thus, the domain is meant to be a play on "John Doe" – a moniker secondarily used to reference the "[everyman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyman)".

With that said, and much more to the point, this project represents a landing hub linking to my most significant online exploits and activities.
