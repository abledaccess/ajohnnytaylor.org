While there's little that is unique about my name offline, I try, however, to provide myself a noteworthy "voice" through various means online: [I blog about my life as a quadriplegic](https://abledaccess.com); [co-organize #a11yTO](http://a11yto.com); perform web accessibility assessments and manual keyboard centered user tests; [guest write](http://simplyaccessible.com/article/being-disabled-can-be-lame/); [jabber on Twitter](https://twitter.com/abledaccess) and [post the visual equivalent of jabbering to Instagram](https://instagram.com/abledaccess).
