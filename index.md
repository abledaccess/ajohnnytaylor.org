<p class="intro">And quite simply, I'm a disabled web worker searching for a little <em>accessible</em> value for us users in and about this medium.</p>

Toward that end, I begin to accomplish this by blogging both <a href="http://unboundedexistence.com" rel="external">the personal</a> and <a href="http://abledaccess.com" rel="external">the technical</a>. <a href="https://github.com/abledaccess/" rel="external">Helping to build solutions for a more inclusive internet</a> by <a href="http://fluidproject.org" rel="external">volunteering my efforts with the Fluid Project</a>. Performing a little web accessibility testing on the side. And <a href="https://twitter.com/abledaccess" rel="external">jabbering on Twitter</a>.

All while looking to rock life just a bit harder than that of the day before&nbsp;&ndash; my promise to you.
