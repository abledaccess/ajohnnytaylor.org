<p class="intro">I'm a disabled web worker. And it's my job to keep web accessibility non-elite!</p>

I begin to accomplish this by [blogging experiences surrounding an existence in this modern digital landscape](https://abledaccess.com). Helping to build solutions for a more inclusive internet by [volunteering my efforts with the Fluid Project](http://fluidproject.org). Performing web accessibility assessments. [Speaking (Latest talk: @a11ycampTO 2015, Between Empathy and Penalty; Session 3, Track D)](http://accessibilitycampto.org/schedule.php#pm1). And [jabbering on Twitter](https://twitter.com/abledaccess).
