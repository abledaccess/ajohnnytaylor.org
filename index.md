<p class="intro">But one of many. I'm a disabled web worker. And it's my job to keep web accessibility non-elite!</p>

I begin to accomplish this by [blogging my experiences surrounding a disabled existence in this modern digital landscape](https://abledaccess.com). [Co-lead organizing #a11yTO](http://a11yto.com). Performing web accessibility assessments. [Writing](http://simplyaccessible.com/article/being-disabled-can-be-lame/). [Speaking (Latest talk: Session 3, Track D)](http://accessibilitycampto.org/schedule.php#pm1). And [jabbering on Twitter](https://twitter.com/abledaccess).
