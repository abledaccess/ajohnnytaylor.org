<p class="intro">But one of many. I'm a disabled web worker, technologica11y enhanced and powered by plants!</p>

I begin to accomplish this by [blogging about a life enhanced by technology](https://abledaccess.com); [co-organizing #a11yTO](http://a11yto.com); performing web accessibility assessments; [writing](http://simplyaccessible.com/article/being-disabled-can-be-lame/); [speaking (Last Talk: Adaptability has very real consequences)](http://accessconf.ca/sessions/); and [jabbering on Twitter](https://twitter.com/abledaccess).
