<p class="intro">But one of many and I'm a disabled web worker. It's my job to keep web accessibility non-elite!</p>

I begin to accomplish this by [blogging about a technologica11y enhanced existence](https://abledaccess.com). [Co-lead organizing #a11yTO](http://a11yto.com). Performing web accessibility assessments. [Writing](http://simplyaccessible.com/article/being-disabled-can-be-lame/). [Speaking (Next Talk: Inaccessibility has very real consequences)](http://accessconf.ca/sessions/). And [jabbering on Twitter](https://twitter.com/abledaccess).
