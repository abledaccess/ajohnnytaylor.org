<p class="intro">And I'm a disabled web worker searching for accessible value for all us users in and about the web medium.</p>

Toward that end, I begin to accomplish this by <a href="https://abledaccess.com" rel="external">blogging experiences surrounding a life in this digital landscape</a>. Helping to build solutions for a more inclusive internet by <a href="http://fluidproject.org" rel="external">volunteering my efforts with the Fluid Project</a>. Performing web accessibility assessments. And <a href="https://twitter.com/abledaccess" rel="external">jabbering on Twitter</a>.
